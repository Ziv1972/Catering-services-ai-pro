# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI-native catering management system for HP Israel. Agent-driven operations across two sites (Nes Ziona, Kiryat Gat). Built around specialist AI agents that use Claude API for intelligence — not a traditional CRUD app.

**Production URLs:**
- Backend: `https://courteous-amazement-production-02e2.up.railway.app`
- Frontend: `https://frontend-production-c346.up.railway.app`

## Commands

### Backend

```

## Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + async SQLAlchemy)

- **Entry point**: `backend/main.py` — FastAPI app with lifespan that auto-creates tables, runs migrations, seeds data, and starts background services
- **Config**: `backend/config.py` — Pydantic `Settings` loaded from `.env`
- **Database**: `backend/database.py` — async SQLAlchemy sessions, auto-detects SQLite vs PostgreSQL
- **Models**: `backend/models/` — 20+ SQLAlchemy ORM models (one per file)
- **API routes**: `backend/api/` — 21 FastAPI routers (150+ endpoints), JWT-protected except auth and webhook test
- **Services**: `backend/services/` — Claude API wrapper, IMAP email poller, menu analysis

### AI Agent System

Two-layer architecture: **individual agents** for focused tasks + **Agent Crew** for multi-agent orchestration.

#### Individual Agents
`backend/agents/orchestrator.py` routes requests to specialist agents extending `BaseAgent`.

| Agent | Status | Directory |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Meeting Prep | Implemented | `backend/agents/meeting_prep/` |
| Complaint Intelligence | Implemented | `backend/agents/complaint_intelligence/` |

### Services

| Service | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Claude API | `backend/services/claude_service.py` | Async Anthropic API wrapper (generate_response, generate_vision_response, generate_with_tools, generate_structured_response) |
| IMAP Email Poller | `backend/services/meal_email_poller.py` | Background Gmail IMAP poller for FoodHouse daily meal reports |
| Menu Analysis | `backend/services/menu_analysis_service.py` | Compliance check engine |

### Data Layer

- **Dev**: SQLite (`catering_ai.db` at project root)
- **Prod**: PostgreSQL 15 (via `DATABASE_URL`)
- Auto-converts URLs to async driver (`sqlite+aiosqlite`, `postgresql+asyncpg`)
- Production data: 11,497 proforma items, 68 Hebrew compliance rules, 89 products

### Key Models (20+)

Core: `User`, `Site`, `Supplier`, `Product`, `Proforma`, `ProformaItem`
Budget: `SupplierBudget`, `SupplierProductBudget`, `MaintenanceBudget`, `MaintenanceExpense`
Compliance: `ComplianceRule`, `MenuCheck`, `CheckResult`, `FineRule`
Operations: `Meeting`, `MeetingNote`, `Complaint`, `ComplaintPattern`, `Anomaly`
Tasks: `Project`, `ProjectTask`, `ProjectDocument`, `TaskStatusHistory`, `TodoItem`
Analytics: `ProductCategoryGroup`, `ProductCategoryMapping`, `WorkingDaysEntry`
Daily Ops: `DailyMealCount`, `HistoricalMealData`, `Attachment`

## Daily Meals Automation Pipeline

Hands-free email → database pipeline for FoodHouse daily meal counts:

1. **IMAP Poller** (`backend/services/meal_email_poller.py`) — Daily at 5:00 AM Israel time + once on startup. Connects to `ziv@foodbiz.co.il` via Gmail IMAP, searches for unread emails with subject `HP_FC_REPORT`, parses `.xlsx` attachment (columns: `restaurant id`, `name`, `count deals`), upserts into `daily_meal_counts`
2. **Webhook** (`POST /api/webhooks/daily-meals`) — Alternative: Power Automate sends JSON/CSV
3. **CSV Upload** (`POST /api/webhooks/daily-meals/upload`) — Manual upload from UI (Hebrew cp1255 encoding)
4. **Manual Trigger** (`POST /api/webhooks/daily-meals/poll-now`) — Force immediate IMAP check
5. **Dashboard** — Grouped bar chart (NZ + KG side-by-side), stacked by meal type. Per-site sidebar: meals vs 6-month avg, cost (meals × unit_price from latest proforma) vs budget

Meal type parsing: `בשרי`→Meat, `חלבי`→Dairy, `עיקרית בלבד`→Main Only
Site parsing: `נס ציונה`→NZ, `קרית גת`→KG
Cost per meal: Meat/Dairy ≈₪39.57, Main Only ≈₪8.87 (from latest FoodHouse proforma)

## Test Infrastructure

Tests use in-memory SQLite via fixtures in `backend/tests/conftest.py`:
- `db_session` — fresh DB per test
- `seed_data` — default user (`test@hp.com` / `testpass123`) + 2 sites
- `client` — authenticated `httpx.AsyncClient` with JWT
- `unauth_client` — unauthenticated client

**Known issue**: `test_dashboard` expects `upcoming_meetings` key but API returns `meetings`

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
- `DATABASE_URL` — SQLite (dev) or PostgreSQL (prod)
- `SECRET_KEY` — JWT signing key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Claude API key
- `CLAUDE_MODEL` — defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

IMAP email poller (for daily meal automation):
- `IMAP_HOST` — e.g. `imap.gmail.com`
- `IMAP_EMAIL` — Gmail address
- `IMAP_PASSWORD` — Gmail App Password (16-char)
- `MEAL_EMAIL_SENDER` — sender filter (partial match)
- `MEAL_EMAIL_SUBJECT` — subject filter (partial match)
- `MEAL_POLL_INTERVAL_MIN` — polling interval (default: 60)

Optional: `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH`

Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)

## Key Patterns

### Claude API calls
```python
from backend.services.claude_service import claude_service
response = await claude_service.generate_structured_response(
    prompt=prompt, system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT, response_format=EXPECTED_SCHEMA
)
```

### Database queries (async SQLAlchemy 2.0)
```python
result = await db.execute(
    select(Model).where(Model.field == value).order_by(Model.created_at.desc())
)
items = result.scalars().all()
```

### API endpoint structure
```python
@router.post("/{id}/action")
async def action(
    id: int, data: RequestSchema,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
```

## Deployment

- **Railway**: Backend via root `Dockerfile` + `railway.json` (health check at `/health`)
- **Frontend**: Separate Railway deployment from `frontend/`
- Startup auto-seeds: admin user, sites, suppliers, budgets, fine rules, products, compliance rules, category groups
- Background: IMAP email poller starts automatically if configured

## Hebrew Content

Compliance rules, meal types, product names, and some domain data are in Hebrew. The system manages catering for HP Israel — Hebrew text in database seeds and UI is expected.

## What's Been Built (56 commits)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- FastAPI backend with async SQLAlchemy, JWT auth, 2-site support
- Next.js 14 frontend with App Router, Tailwind, Recharts
- AI agents: Meeting Prep + Complaint Intelligence
- Real data migration from FoodHouse Analytics

### Phase 2: Dashboard & Analytics
- Dashboard overhaul: budget cards, project status, maintenance, todos, AI chat widget
- Budget drill-down: 4-stage cascading (supplier → month → site → category → products)
- Product category analysis with 4-level drill-down (9 category groups, 50+ mappings)
- Analytics page: cost (4 levels) and quantity (5 levels) drill-down
- Working days management per site/month

### Phase 3: Operations
- Complaints with fines, pattern detection, weekly AI summaries
- File upload for projects/tasks with AI processing (summarize/extract)
- Price list generation from proformas, cross-list comparison
- Supplier spending charts, price comparison for proformas
- Menu compliance: upload, rules management, check results

### Phase 4: Daily Meal Automation
- DailyMealCount model with upsert logic
- Webhook endpoints for Power Automate + CSV upload
- IMAP email poller: `ziv@foodbiz.co.il` → Gmail IMAP → parses HP_FC_REPORT.xlsx → upserts meals
- Daily scheduler: runs once at 5:00 AM Israel time + once on startup
- Dashboard: grouped bar chart (NZ + KG side-by-side), stacked by meal type (Meat/Dairy/Main Only)
- Per-site sidebar: meals vs 6-month avg + cost (meals × unit_price from proformas) vs budget
- Manual trigger endpoint for testing

### Phase 5: UI/UX Overhaul + Price Lists
- Dashboard redesign: modern KPI cards, semantic color tokens (CSS custom properties), animated transitions, responsive grid
- Price list management overhaul: CSV upload with multi-encoding support (utf-8, cp1255, latin-1) and auto column detection (EN/HE headers)
- Inline price/unit editing with hover-to-reveal actions, add product with catalog auto-creation, duplicate detection
- Backend endpoints: PUT/DELETE items, POST add-product, POST upload CSV
- Branding: "Catering AI Pro" header, "HP Israel - Ziv Reshef Simchoni" subtitle + footer
- Menu compliance rules: search box + category filter pills with counts

### Phase 6: Agent Crew + Fine Rule Intelligence
- **Agent Crew system**: 10-agent orchestration (1 manager + 9 specialists) with intent analysis, parallel execution, result synthesis
- **All 6 AI agents implemented**: Budget Intelligence, Dietary Compliance, Event Coordination, Communication Hub (no longer stubs)
- **Agent Crew frontend page**: `/agent-crew` with crew dashboard, chat interface, agent cards, interaction map
- **Fine rule import from PDF**: Upload contract PDF → AI extracts rules in Hebrew → preview modal with per-rule toggle → replace seeded rules
- **Auto-match complaints to fines**: AI suggests matching fine rule with confidence score when complaint is created, auto-links at ≥70% confidence
- **Deploy fix**: Committed 8 missing agent crew files that caused Railway healthcheck failures
- **File existence check**: Detects ephemeral filesystem file loss after Railway redeployment

### Phase 6b: AI Menu Compliance Overhaul (2026-03-25)
- **AI-powered compliance check**: Replaced broken rule-based matching with Claude AI as default. Falls back to rules if API unavailable
- **Intelligent Hebrew matching**: 30+ dish synonym examples in prompt (בריסקט=חזה בקר, שווארמה דג≠אמנון, etc.)
- **Dynamic frequency calculation**: Uses actual working days per month, not hardcoded ×4 weeks
- **Anomaly detection**: Flags vague dish names, consecutive-day repeats, same-day duplicates, >1 ground meat/day
- **Version-numbered Excel export**: `KG menu check - April 2026 version 1.xlsx` with "חוסרים" sheet matching manual check format
- **Frontend AI evidence**: Shows matched items, frequency text, notes from Claude; hides old "Searched keyword" UI for AI results
- **Max tokens fix**: Increased from 4096 to 16384 for AI compliance check (was silently truncating)

### Phase 6c: PDF Proforma Upload Fix (2026-03-26)
- **PDF Hebrew RTL fix**: pdfplumber extracts reversed Hebrew text in RTL PDFs — parser now detects and reverses it
- **Header validation**: After table extraction, validates headers against known keywords (מוצר, כמות, מחיר, product, quantity, price)
- **AI fallback**: If pdfplumber headers are unrecognizable even after reversal, skips to Claude AI text extraction
- **Three-strategy pipeline**: 1) pdfplumber table + fix reversed Hebrew → 2) AI structured extraction from raw text → 3) error with guidance

### Phase 6d: Project Improvements + AI Assistant Tool-Use (Latest — 2026-03-26b)
- **Overdue task highlight**: Tasks with past due dates + not done get light red background (`bg-red-50`), red due date text + ⚠ icon
- **Task status change history**: `TaskStatusHistory` model logs every status change with from_status, to_status, changed_at, changed_by. Shown in expanded task view
- **Gantt chart view**: List/Gantt toggle on project detail page. Custom component with horizontal task bars, month headers, today marker (red line), status-colored bars, legend
- **AI Assistant tool-use**: Complete rewrite of `backend/api/chat.py` using Claude tool-use with 8 data query tools:
  - `query_spending`: Product-level proforma items by supplier/site/month with optional product search
  - `query_budgets`: Budget allocations with monthly breakdown
  - `query_meals`: Daily meal counts by type and site
  - `query_violations`: Violations with severity, fines, patterns
  - `query_meetings`: Upcoming/past meetings
  - `query_price_lists`: Price comparison across suppliers
  - `query_projects`: Projects with tasks and deadlines
  - `query_summary`: High-level operational dashboard
- **Tool-use loop**: Claude chains up to 5 tool calls per question for comprehensive answers
- **Chart rendering**: `ChatMessageRenderer` component parses ````chart` JSON blocks into inline Recharts bar/line/pie charts
- **Table rendering**: Markdown tables in AI responses rendered as styled HTML tables
- **Excel export**: `POST /api/chat/export` generates downloadable .xlsx files (spending items, budgets, meals)
- **`generate_with_tools()`**: New method on `ClaudeService` for tool-use API calls

## Session Summary Rules

**CRITICAL**: When asked to summarize a session, ALWAYS:
1. Read `README.md` roadmap section to compare against the original plan
2. Show what was in the original roadmap vs what's been built vs what's remaining
3. Update CLAUDE.md and README.md with any new features built
4. Never lose track of the original 6-phase agent roadmap from README.md
